Our task is to perform an analysis of the Wikipedia Hyperlink graph. For this purpose we use the Wikipedia graph released by the _[SNAP group](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ghPJ4g6XMCUDFQ2JPqAVveLyytG8gBfL/view)_.

This directory has two files: 

&emsp;`Hw5.ipynb`: a file containing all the execution of the required tasks, such as:  

&emsp;`functions.py`: a file containing the algorithms for the homework. 

some files have not been uploaded due to their big size:
- the dictionary output of the shortest path algorithm
- the dictionary of the categories
